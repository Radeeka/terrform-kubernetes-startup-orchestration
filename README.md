# Kubernetes Object Startup Sequence Control with Terraform

This repository provides a Terraform script (`sequence.tf`) that allows you to control the startup sequence of objects in a Kubernetes cluster according to your specific requirements. The script was developed to address the need to restrict the startup of certain pods until specific jobs are finished. The goal is to provision the entire workload as Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and manage the startup sequence programmatically.

## Introduction

In Kubernetes, ensuring the correct startup sequence of objects, such as pods and jobs, can be crucial to meet application dependencies and requirements. This Terraform script provides a solution for defining and managing the sequence in which these objects should start.

## File Description

- `sequence.tf`: This Terraform script defines the logic and configurations for controlling the startup sequence of objects in a Kubernetes cluster. It can be customized to specify the order in which objects should be created or started.

## Usage

To control the startup sequence of objects in your Kubernetes cluster using the provided Terraform script (`sequence.tf`), follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/radeeka/terrform-kubernetes-startup-orchestration.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```shell
   cd terrform-kubernetes-startup-orchestration
   ```

3. Customize the `sequence.tf` script to define the desired startup sequence for your Kubernetes objects. You can specify dependencies and order as needed.

4. Deploy the Terraform configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```shell
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Monitor the deployment process and ensure that the objects start in the desired sequence.

## Customization

The `sequence.tf` script is designed to be highly customizable to meet your specific requirements. You can define dependencies, specify the order in which objects should start, and adjust other settings as needed to control the startup sequence effectively.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance and improve this Terraform script for controlling startup sequences are welcome. If you encounter issues, have suggestions, or want to contribute improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
